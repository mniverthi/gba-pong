This is a simple pong implementation for two players on the GameBoy Advance.
The game has a start screen, rule screen, in-game screen, and end screen.
To play the game, the first player uses the arrow keys, while the second player uses the 'A' and 'B' keys.
The first player to 10 wins. 
At any time, the user can press the 'SELECT' key to reset the game back to the start screen.
Happy ping-pong-ing!
